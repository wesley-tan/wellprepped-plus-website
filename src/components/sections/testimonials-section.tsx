    review: 'Mr. Ammiel is the best tutor I have ever learned with. As a student who did not study IGCSE Economics, I was seriously underprepared to go into IB Higher Level Economics. However, my concerns all went away when Mr. Ammiel started tutoring me. His detailed notes on definitions, diagrams, and concepts for each subtopic of the IB Econs syllabus were very clear. His teaching style is not only encouraging but thorough. He always makes time to respond online to your questions or to mark your essay homework before you turn them in. Thank you abundantly Mr. Ammiel!',

    review: 'Ammiel is an outstanding economics tutor. His ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and relatable way has made a significant difference in my understanding of the subject. He is super methodical in his approach and always ensures that every detail is covered. Ammiel answered all my questions patiently, breaking down difficult topics into manageable pieces and making them easy to grasp. Thanks to his excellent guidance, I achieved a 7 in IB Economics. His approachable teaching style creates a comfortable learning environment, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding. Highly recommended!',

    review: 'Although my son was resistant to tuition, Abel was able to connect with him such that he was more accepting of help and even willing to go for extra tuition. Abel went out of his way to give my son tuition physically and at later stages before. Despite my son being initially resistant to online tuition before engaging Abel, he was receptive and very willing to do so with Abel, as he explained concepts well, and was friendly and caring',

    school: 'ACS Independent',
    review: 'I attended WellPreppedâ€™s TOK Essay Masterclass. The essay titles were broken down and explained very clearly which helped me understand the demands of the questions better. The lecture also allowed me to clarify my queries and made me aware of points to consider when writing the essay that were not brought up in school!',

Overall, I highly recommend Abel for his expertise and supportive approach to tutoring.",
